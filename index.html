        <strong>
        A-Z of BIBLE CHARACTERS for CHILDREN
         </strong>
    </p>
    <p class="pa paj">
           
        I want to let you know that my book A-Z of Bible Characters for Children will soon be released, this new release will be the workbook edition of the first published work. The first edition received a warm acceptance and the one thousand copies printed was sold in the space of 60 days. The feedback from the few families that got it suggested we should add workbook to it which is birthing this workbook edition. 
    </p>
    <p class="pa paj">
            
        I am glad to let you know that one of the leading Christian book distributor in Africa among others have considered the book for approval for nationwide distribution.  Needless to say that we have been receiving many proposals for distributorships supplies from nooks and crannies on the book requests from individuals, churches, schools and governments. I feel you and your movement should be a beneficiary of the book that teaches moral values and leadership characters for the children to emulates and or avoid.   
    </p>

        The book is a good Sunday School material. It's also good for schools and home studies.
    </p>
    <p class="pa paj">
            
        The 32 pages book is well written to address the moral decadence challenges facing the todays children breeded from the environment and society they found themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="pa paj">
            
        Here what a Christian Education scholar says about the book:
    </p>
    <p class="pa paj">
            
        "A  juvenile book  like this is needed at this period of our national life when moral values had fallen very low in Nigeria. The Christian Education holds the key to moral regeneration in our nation.   Hope the book will be on the shelf of every Nigerian family in Nigeria.
         Congratulations on publishing this book."
       <br><strong> - Alaba Olusemore, PhD </strong>
