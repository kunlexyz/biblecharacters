irstly; I am dedicating this book to God Almighty, in whom by His grace gave me 
the strength and wisdom to publish this 
book.
</div> 
<div class="pa">
To my godfather; Revd. John M. Dansu, who has 
been sustaining and encouraging me with 
spiritual balance diets. His godly character and 
discipline has continued to keep me fit and strong 
in the Lord for the earthly task and heavenly 
race.
</div>
<div class="pa">
To all my godfather's children in the Lord, that irrespective 
of the daunting task still keeps on the vision of 
God’s kingdom, so as to win the awaited glorious 
crown.
</div>
<div class="pa">
Finally, I extend my deep regards and 
appreciation to all my friends, well wishers, and 
colleagues. To those whose God's mercy has 
touched spiritually for Gods work, and to 
all our children who are the hopes of tomorrow. 
Surely, you are blessed and the mercy of God 
will come upon you all. Amen.

<div class="pa paj">Bunmi Johnson has done it again!<br />

<div class="drop_cap" style="width:35px;" >I</div>
f you thought the first edition was mind blowing, then get ready to be blown away by this workbook edition. The reaction from the first edition was supportive and warm, which gave Bunmi the wings to fly again this time even higher.

</div>
<div class="pa paj">
This book will inspire readers to bring positive changes in their surroundings as it would help open their minds to the good qualities they must possess to become great leaders. Bunmi highlights great characters in the bible who made themselves available to be used by God which is worthy of emulation. He also portrayed those characters that should not be looked up to as a result of their negative attributes.

</div>
<div class="pa paj">
I congratulate Bunmi Johnson once again for an amazing work done and strongly recommend this book for every child in the christian and secular environment.

GODLY CHARACTER
</div>
<div class="pad paj">
<div class="drop_cap" >G
</div>OD wants us to train our children in the way they should go, so that when they grow they would not depart from it.
</div>

<div class="pad paj">
The Bible characters in-view can be seen from 2 perspectives: the 
character as a personality and the character as an attitudinal exposition.
</div>

<div class="pad paj">
The character a child exhibits today is as a result of what the 
home, community and the nation has invested in him/her 
yesterday. This is the reason the Bible says “what you sow 
shall you reap.” 
</div>

<div class="pad paj">
Nevertheless, to “whom much is given, much is expected.” This is 
 evident i the character of a child like Timothy who came 
from the lineage of a Christian family, and eventually became an 
evangelist. This is unlike the case of the character of Korah who 
rebelled against Moses and Aaron. The attitudes of 
these 2 characters mentioned cannot be far-fetched from what their 
respective homes, societies and communities have invested in 
them from the cradle, which they invariably gave back 
respectively to their society. No wonder the great philosopher 
and poet William Wordsworth says: “the child is the father of 
the man.”
</div>

<div class="pad paj">
I enjoin parents to invest Godly characters, which is of great value 
in their children. I am sure they will reap it back from them in future.
</div>

<div class="pad paj">
Believe me, this book is not only interesting, it will
also help our children to build Godly characters that will make 
them enviable and exemplary individuals in their homes, 
societies and the nation as a whole.<br />
Remain blessed.
